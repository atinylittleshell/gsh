## Must have before v1 release

- User config should merge with default config instead of replacing it
- Ctrl+R - Search Command History
- Ctrl+D is printing "exit" twice
- Primary color yellow (esp. completion panel)
- "G Shell" terminology
- Support MCP servers for REPL agent

## Nice to have

- Syntax highlighting for command being typed in REPL
- Markdown rendering for agent text responses in REPL
