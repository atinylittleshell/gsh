# Getting Started with gsh_prime

gsh_prime is an actively maintained fork of gsh focused on a faster development cycle while remaining compatible and regularly contributing improvements upstream.

Upstream project: https://github.com/atinylittleshell/gsh
Fork repository: https://github.com/robottwo/gsh_prime

If you're new, start here to install, build, and run gsh_prime quickly.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- Go 1.21+ installed and in your PATH

## Install and Build

Packaging for gsh_prime is in progress. For now, build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robottwo/gsh_prime.git
cd gsh_prime
make build
# The binary will be in ./bin/gsh
```

To make the binary available on your PATH:

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 bin/gsh /usr/local/bin/gsh
```

### Upgrading

gsh includes self-update support. When a new version is available, it can automatically detect and offer to update.

## Launching gsh_prime

### Manual

Start gsh from an existing shell:

```bash
gsh
```

### Automatically from your shell

Add gsh to your shell configuration so it starts automatically:

```bash
# bash
echo "gsh" | tee -a ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
# zsh
echo "gsh" | tee -a ~/.zshrc
# If you have an alias named gsh for git show, use the full path
echo "/usr/local/bin/gsh" | tee -a ~/.zshrc
```

### As your login shell

Not recommended yet, but if you know what you are doing:

```bash
which gsh
echo "/path/to/gsh" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
chsh -s "/path/to/gsh"
```
