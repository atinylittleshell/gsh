- Look at the full content of spec/GSH_V1_PLAN.md and spec/GSH_SCRIPT_SPEC.md
- Implement only the next pending work item in the plan, cover it with test cases, make sure all tests pass
- Run "make build" and ensure no issues
- Update spec/GSH_V1_PLAN.md to mark the work item done - do NOT leave any implementation notes while doing so
