- Look at `spec/GSH_LANG_EBOOK.md` to find the chapter plan
- Identify the next chapter marked as TODO - that's the one to write. Only write one.
- Read `spec/GSH_SCRIPT_SPEC.md` and relevant code files for language details needed for the chapter
- Write the chapter following the structure: opening → core concepts → examples → key takeaways → what's next
- Use conversational tone, concrete examples before abstraction, active voice
- Every code example must be complete, tested, and actually runnable in gsh
- Include output/results for all examples
- Link to previous/next chapters with relative markdown links
- The chapter file should already exist with empty content - you need to overwrite it
- Mark the chapter as DONE in `spec/GSH_LANG_EBOOK.md` when finished
- Delete any temp test files you created
